# Debugging Practice

## Problem Description
The starter code contains *several* errors. Correct them all.
The program should prompt the user for their favorite math class and respond that it loves that class.

## Example
```
user input: algebra
output: I love algebra!
```

## Notes
* Test your code with at least two different inputs to be sure it works as expected.
* Commit and Push to GitHub
* Check the repo website and look for a green check mark. That indicates the tests have passed successfully.
  * If you see a yellow dot, that means GitHub is still running the test. Keep refreshing the window until the circle changes.
  * If you see a red X, one or both tests have failed and there is an error in your program. See Megan for help finding the feedback in GitHub so you know what issue(s) to resolve.
